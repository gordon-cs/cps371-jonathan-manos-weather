# Jon and AJ's Weather App

InstaWeather - A simple one page weather application that first displays the
weather for the current location and then has a google maps autocomplete
search box to select another location which instantly updates the weather
information upon selection.

# Improvements from Previous Version

* Removed Google Maps Display - Unnecessary to weather information and confused
most users.
* Removed Use of Separate Tabs - Changed display to show all information on one
page.
* Changed Format of Display - Instead of using cards to display information,
Used rows and columns to display information more beautifully.
